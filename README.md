# pi2arduino
Example code showing implementation of @PowerBroker2's pySerialTransfer and SerialTransfer on both the Python side and Arduino C++ side. 

This example demonstrates sending a bool and a dummy byte from the Python program to the Arduino, receiving and operating on the data with the Arduino in the form of setting an LED, and then sending that same data back over serial, where it is received, processed, and displayed by the Python program.
